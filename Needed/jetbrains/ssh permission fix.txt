Here are the steps you can take:

Check File Permissions:
Use the ls -l /Users/firozanam/jetbrains/scripts/install.sh command to view the file's permissions.

If you don't have execute permissions (denoted by -rwxr-xr-x), proceed to the next step.

Grant Execute Permissions:
Use the chmod +x /Users/firozanam/jetbrains/scripts/install.sh command to grant execute permissions to the file.

Rerun the Script:
Attempt to execute the script again using the same command: /Users/firozanam/jetbrains/scripts/install.sh

Consider Administrative Privileges:
If the script still fails with a permission error, you may need to run it with administrative privileges using sudo: sudo /Users/firozanam/jetbrains/scripts/install.sh

Review Script Content:
If the permission error persists, examine the script's contents for any potential issues or dependencies that might be causing the problem.

Additional Tips:
Double-check the file path: Ensure you're using the correct path to the script.
Verify file integrity: If you downloaded the script, make sure it downloaded correctly and isn't corrupted.
Check for dependencies: If the script requires other programs or tools, ensure they are installed on your system.
Consult documentation: Refer to the script's documentation or support resources for specific troubleshooting steps.
